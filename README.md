# Werewolves

Werewolves is a multiplayer (server based) game in which participants are divided into two groups: werewolves and townspeople, with the goal being to eliminate members of the opposing group. Werewolves can eat townspeople at night and are outnumbered but know each other’s identities. The townspeople don’t know the identities of the werewolves, so they must rely on inference. There is also a moderator, which control the game, and a witch, which is able to bring a person back to life after being mauled by a werewolf, but only once, with a healing potion. The game is ideal for teaching about hacking because privacy and confidentiality are important for the werewolves. Students use what is called “covert channel attacks” — an attack that exploits communication channels, much like hacking — to identify werewolves. Exploits include taking advantage of race conditions, file permission issues, tcp traffic sniffing and timing attacks, and command line injection.
